        <p>
          I am Vedaste Mugabo, a dynamic and multi-talented individual with a
          strong foundation in computer science, healthcare, and technology. As
          a second-year medical student at the University of Rwanda, I am

          software testing, data engineering, and digital consulting. With over
          5 years of experience in software testing and a proven track record as
          a Digital Consultant at Climax Technology Ltd, I have honed my skills
          in delivering high-quality digital solutions.

          I hold multiple certifications, including AI Career Essentials and
          Virtual Assistant from ALX, as well as Data Engineering from ICT
          Chambers. I am also involved in community service, volunteering with
          Tubeheza to help provide shelter, and participating in local
          initiatives like Umuganda and Itorero. Fluent in English, Kinyarwanda,
          and Kirundi, I offer language services such as translation,
          interpretation, and content creation.
