      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am Vedaste Mugabo, a dynamic and multi-talented individual with a
        strong foundation in computer science, healthcare, and technology. As
        a second-year medical student at the University of Rwanda, I am
        passionate about healthcare while also leveraging my expertise in
        software testing, data engineering, and digital consulting. With over
        5 years of experience in software testing and a proven track record as
        a Digital Consultant at Climax Technology Ltd, I have honed my skills
        in delivering high-quality digital solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold multiple certifications, including AI Career Essentials and
        Virtual Assistant from ALX, as well as Data Engineering from ICT
        Chambers. I am also involved in community service, volunteering with
        Tubeheza to help provide shelter, and participating in local
        initiatives like Umuganda and Itorero. Fluent in English, Kinyarwanda,
        and Kirundi, I offer language services such as translation,
        interpretation, and content creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        My approach to work is driven by a passion for continuous learning and
        a dedication to achieving excellence in everything I do.
